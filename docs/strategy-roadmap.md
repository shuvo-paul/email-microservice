# ðŸ§­ Strategy Roadmap
## Email Notification Microservice

---

## ðŸŽ¯ 1. Vision

Build a robust, scalable, and developer-friendly microservice to handle transactional and notification emails across multiple services in a distributed system. The goal is to **centralize email logic**, ensure **high delivery reliability**, and allow **pluggable architecture** for future providers.

---

## ðŸš€ 2. Mission Statement

Provide a production-grade email notification service that:
- Works asynchronously and scales horizontally.
- Supports SMTP initially, with the flexibility to switch to APIs (SendGrid, Mailgun).
- Offers fast setup, clear documentation, and structured logging for traceability.

## ðŸ§© 3. Strategic Goals (6â€“12 Months)

| Goal                                   | Target Quarter | Description                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Deliver MVP with SMTP + retry logic    | Q3 2025        | Include worker pool, health check, `.env` support          |
| Add CC/BCC + job IDs                   | Q3 2025        | Enable richer email composition and tracking               |
| Implement metrics & Prometheus support | Q3 2025        | For observability and performance monitoring               |
| Introduce Redis or NATS queue backend  | Q3 2025        | Improve reliability under high load                        |
| Add support for email templates        | Q4 2025        | Use dynamic placeholders with localization options         |
| Switch to external API providers       | Q4 2025        | Enable fallback or replacement for SMTP                    |
| Integrate with company-wide audit logs | Q4 2025        | For end-to-end observability across services               |

## ðŸ‘¥ 4. Target Users

| Group           | Use Case                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Backend Teams   | Trigger transactional emails (signup, reset) |
| DevOps          | Monitor delivery & service availability  |
| QA Engineers    | Validate email flow in staging/testing   |

---

## ðŸ›‘ 5. Problems This Solves

- Removes email-sending logic from other services
- Enables retries and failure recovery
- Centralizes configuration and provider handling
- Makes email activity observable and debuggable

---

## ðŸ“Š 6. Strategic Priorities

1. **Reliability First**: Message delivery must be consistent and recover from transient errors.
2. **Observability**: Metrics and logs must support alerting and root cause analysis.
3. **Developer Experience**: API should be intuitive with solid docs and consistent behavior.
4. **Extensibility**: Modular codebase ready for third-party provider support.
5. **Infrastructure Ready**: Easy deployment to Kubernetes or any container platform.

---

## âœ… 7. Success Metrics

- 99.9% email delivery rate under nominal load
- >95% of features covered with automated tests
- 100% of service metrics accessible in Prometheus/Grafana
- <5s response time from `POST /send` to SMTP dispatch
- Onboarding time for new devs: <30 minutes
