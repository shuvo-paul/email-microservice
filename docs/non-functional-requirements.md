## üìå 1. Introduction

This document outlines the non-functional requirements (NFRs) for the Email Notification Microservice. These requirements define how the system should behave under various conditions, focusing on performance, reliability, scalability, security, maintainability, and other system-wide qualities.

## üöÄ 2. Performance Requirements

| ID   | Requirement                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR1 | The system shall be able to process and enqueue up to 1000 email jobs/second. |
| NFR2 | The average latency from job submission to successful email delivery should not exceed 5 seconds under normal load. |
| NFR3 | The system shall maintain a job queue throughput of at least 95% under load burst conditions. |

---

## üîí 3. Security Requirements

| ID   | Requirement                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR4 | All SMTP credentials shall be loaded securely from environment variables or secrets manager. |
| NFR5 | Emails shall be transmitted using encrypted TLS connections.                |
| NFR6 | Internal endpoints (e.g., metrics, health checks) shall be restricted or protected behind a secure gateway. |
| NFR7 | The service shall be protected from email header injection or malformed inputs. |

## üìà 4. Scalability Requirements

| ID   | Requirement                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR8 | The service shall support horizontal scaling of worker pools via configuration. |
| NFR9 | The job queue size shall be configurable to accommodate varying throughput demands. |
| NFR10| The retry system shall operate independently and scale linearly with failure load. |

## üîÅ 5. Reliability & Availability

| ID   | Requirement                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR11| The service shall have 99.9% uptime over a 30-day period.                   |
| NFR12| All email jobs that fail due to transient errors shall be retried automatically. |
| NFR13| Graceful shutdown shall ensure in-flight jobs are completed or handed off.  |
| NFR14| The retry system shall support exponential backoff with jitter.             |

---

## üõ† 6. Maintainability & Observability

| ID   | Requirement                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR15| The service shall log all actions using structured JSON format.             |
| NFR16| The system shall expose a `/health` endpoint for readiness and liveness checks. |
| NFR17| All major operations (enqueue, send, retry, fail) shall be logged with traceable job IDs. |
| NFR18| The system shall support Prometheus metrics for observability.              |

---

## üö¶ 7. Compliance & Standards

| ID   | Requirement                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR19| The service shall adhere to RFC 5321/5322 standards for SMTP email delivery. |
| NFR20| Emails must be well-formed and conform to common HTML and MIME standards.   |

---

## üìÖ 8. Configuration & Extensibility

| ID   | Requirement                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR21| All operational parameters (queue size, retry attempts, worker count) shall be externally configurable. |
| NFR22| The system shall allow easy integration of third-party email APIs in the future. |
| NFR23| Retry behavior (policy, delay strategy) shall be pluggable or overridable.  |

---

## ‚úÖ 9. Success Criteria

- Meets or exceeds all latency and throughput benchmarks in performance tests.
- Sustains expected availability during stress and failure simulations.
- Securely delivers emails with no data leakage or unauthorized access.
- Logs are parseable and sufficient for real-time monitoring and postmortem analysis.
